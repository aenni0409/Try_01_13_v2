I am now a Master student in Statistics at University of California Davis and plannig to graduate on December 2017. I enjoyed solving problem by applying data analysis and statistics. Statistics just like a language  which can express uncertainty by using numbers. Recently, my study mainly focus on data preprocessing and machine learning. My programming skills include R, Python, SQLite, MATLAB, and Git.

<p>
My interest in statistics is wide. I achieved my bachelor degree which is B.S in Business Administration at National Cheng Kung University. Therefore, I learned and worked on how to apply statistics methods on solving business problems. On the other hand, I also applied statistics on medical researches. My undergradate project focused on genetic data and my independent study during my exchange period focused on the causal inference on fMRI data.
