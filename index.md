<h3>  My name is Chia-Hui. Here are my working courses, projects, and myself. </h3>

<p>I am now a Master student in Statistics at University of California Davis and plannig to graduate on December 2017. I enjoyed solving problem by using data analysis and statistics. Recently, my study mainly focus on data preprocessing and machine learning. My programming skills include R, Python, SQLite, MATLAB, and Git.</p>

<p>My interest in statistics is wide. I got my bachelor degree which is B.S in Business Administration at National Cheng Kung University. Therefore, I learned how to apply statistics methods on solving business problems. On the other hand, I also applied statistics on medical researches. My undergradte project focused on genetic data and my independent study during my exchange period focused on the causal inference on fMRI data. </p>
