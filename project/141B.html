<h2><strong>Where Should You Invest In California Real Estate?</strong></h2>
<h3> Purpose </h3>
    <p> 
    According to statistics from U.S. Census Bureau in 2016, the median housing price in California is much higher than the median 
    in U.S for 50,000 dollars. The reasons are not only overwhelm demanding from residents or prospective residents but also the 
    extraordinary price changes inside California. Although the median housing price is relatively high, if we can know more about 
    regions where are worthwhile to invest, we can avoid buying house with unreasonable price. Therefore, in this project, we will 
    use Zillow housing price data for each counties in California and some features to find the potential invest and let people 
    know more about housing price in California.
