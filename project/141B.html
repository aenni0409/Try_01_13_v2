<h2><strong>Where Should You Invest In California Real Estate?</strong></h2>
<h3> Purpose </h3>
    <p> 
    According to statistics from U.S. Census Bureau in 2016, the median housing price in California is much higher than thoes 
    in U.S for over 50,000 dollars. The reasons are not only overwhelm demanding from residents or prospective residents but also the 
    extraordinary price changes inside California. Although the median housing price is relatively high, we still can know more about 
    regions where are worthwhile to invest and where should be avoided buying house with unreasonable price. 
    Therefore, in this project, we will use Zillow housing price data for each counties in California and some features to find the 
    best combination of feature of house with housing price and let people know more about housing price in California.

<h3> Data Description </h3>
<h3> Time-Series Data </h3>
<li> Mean an Median All-homes pric in California<li>
    According to the time-series line below, we can find that the housing price from 1996 to Jun 2007 was increased. However, after mid-year
    2007, the price started to decrease. One of the main reason is the subprime mortgage crisis has started and a collapse of housing bubble
    started from December 2007 to June 2009. Not until 2011, the housing price has started to increase. For the fill with gray is the error
    bar with one standard deviation. You can find that even in the California, in different counties still have significant difference in the
    median housing price. Therefore, we nee to discuss every county seperately later.
